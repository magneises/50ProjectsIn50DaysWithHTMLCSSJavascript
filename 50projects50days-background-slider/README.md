## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- Increased my understanding of the before pseduo selector and use cases
- Increased my understanding of aligning items centered, as witht he .arrow class in the styles sheet. Using top: 50% and transform: translateY(-50%) to position the navigation arrows EXACTLY centered. 

```
.arrow {
    position: fixed;
    background-color: transparent;
    padding: 20px;
    font-size: 30px;
    border: 2px solid orange;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translateY(-50%);
    z-index: 100;

}
```

## Future Improvements

- Adding more images
- Allow users to create a profile
- allowing a favorites list
- adding fun facts
- working with an api e.g. The Dog api
