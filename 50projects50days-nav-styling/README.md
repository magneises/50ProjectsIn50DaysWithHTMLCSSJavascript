# Animated Nav Styling

## Project Objectives
- Build a navigation bar from scratch
- Style the navigation bar using CSS
- Add animation to toggle the navigation open and closed

## Application
This type of navigation is commonly used in both desktop and mobile web applications for intuitive user interface and space-saving design.

## What I Learned
- How to create and style a basic nav bar
- How to apply CSS animations for interactive UI components
- In Git, not properly closing a commit message with a quote (e.g., `git commit -m "message`) results in a double quote continuation prompt (`dquote>`), which can be exited using `Ctrl + C`
