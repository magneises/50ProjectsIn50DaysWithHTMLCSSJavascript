# Incrementing Counter Project
## General Description
Build an incremental counter using "data-target" attribute. 

## Project completion 
Successfully used the data-target attribtue and adjusted the counting speed from the default 200 to 300. 

## Learnings
Never used the data-target attribute and wished I've discovered it earlier. 

## Possibl Next Steps
Interesting next add-on to this project is to connect this counter to an external data source via api.
